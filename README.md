# meetable
A lightweight, no-fuss meeting scheduler. Calendar importing saves you the work of cross referencing your calendar with everyone elses, or inputting it by hand.

## March 27, 2017
All PRs merged.

TODO at next meeting:
- Plot out the next 2-3 PR goals for each of us so we can all work on our own time.
- Hopefully have time to code!

## March 22, 2017 - Video call meeting  
- To do for rest of spring break:  
  - Everyone: test Casey's and Shayan's pull requests  
  - Josh: manage merge conflicts  
  - Casey: re-organize Flow Router to have Flow Group Routes  
  - David and Shayan: pulling and displaying Google calendar information
- David - started pulling Google Calendar data
  - Currently just prints next 10 events from one of the logged in userâ€™s calendars to the meteor terminal
  - Next step: allow user to choose which calendars to print the events of, and fix errors for certain calendars
     
## March 21, 2017 - Email SMTP Setup (Josh)
- Decided to use MailGun due to convenience of Sandbox URL and fairly competitive free package.
- Added a convenient email client-side hook to server-side email delivery (asynchronous)
- Still haven't set up custom domain since we don't have one. I tried using mine but for some reason it won't verify my DNS info... Might be an issue we have to tackle later.
  - Currently can only test by emailing me (jsbecker AT princeton)

## March 21, 2017 - User accounts updates (Casey)
- added an error page for any url that isn't properly routed to (helpful for checking to see if my routes are working) 
- added a dashboard page which pulls the first name of user from Google profile to display a welcome message. ~~Still haven't linked it so that the site automatically goes to this page after signing in.~~ Implemented automatic redirection on sign-in in second commit.
  - one issue with the name feature is that it requires people to have put a first name in their Google profile, which not everyone has (i.e. I never personalized my Princeton account)
- request Cal permissions by doing away with {{> atForm}} and instead rolling out our own Google authentication with Meteor.signinWithGoogle()
