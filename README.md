# Meetable
Meetings made easy. Stop cross referencing your calendar while clicking individual slots that you're available every time you want to schedule a meeting. With Meetable, all you need to do is log in and send an invitation to a meeting and you're good to go. We find slots that work with both your calendar and everyone you've invited to ensure you only have to decide between times that work for all of you, instead of wasting time figuring out when you're all available in the first place.
